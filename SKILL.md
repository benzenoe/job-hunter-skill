## Example Cover Letter

**For: Director of Digital Operations at Luxembourg Real Estate Group**

Dear Hiring Team,

After scaling a direct-to-consumer e-commerce business to multi-million dollar revenues and building AI-powered real estate operations across two continents, I know what it takes to transform digital operations from cost center to competitive advantage. Your search for a Director of Digital Operations caught my attention because it sits at the intersection of everything I've spent 20+ years mastering.

At SoldHere, I implemented AI and automation tools that optimized customer targeting and operational workflows across our Portugal and US operations. Previously, as founder of BeachStore.com, I built and led all digital operations—SEO, advertising, logistics, and customer experience—growing it to market leadership for over 15 years. More recently, at REIGNation, I architected the technology stack serving 400+ real estate professionals, integrating AI tools that measurably improved member engagement and business outcomes.

Luxembourg's position as a European hub for innovation, combined with your company's reputation in the real estate sector, makes this an opportunity I'm genuinely excited about. I'm looking to bring my operational expertise and technology vision to an organization ready to lead, not follow.

I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience translates to your specific challenges. I'm available for a conversation at your convenience.

Best regards,
Eytan Benzeno
